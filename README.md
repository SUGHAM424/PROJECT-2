# PROJECT-2
This project showcases a responsive HTML and CSS implementation of a personal Dream Bucket List. The list uses semantic HTML, emojis, and visual status indicators to distinguish between completed and pending goals. Styled with modern CSS, it features clear typography, intuitive color schemes, and smooth responsiveness for various screen sizes.
